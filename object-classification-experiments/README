DESCRIPTION
===========

This code has been developed in partial fulfillment of the M.Tech thesis
"Explorations on a neurologically plausible model of image object classification"
by Sourabh Daptardar, Y7111009, CSE, IIT Kanpur.

This code implements:
1) Biologically inspired model of Serre-Wolf-Poggio 
http://cbcl.mit.edu/projects/cbcl/publications/ps/serre-PID73457-05.pdf
and a number of variations with the model.
2) Unsupervised normalized graph cut (Shi-Malik algorithm) based clustering technique (Split-Merge approach).
3) Downloader uitility for downloading images from Google Image Search

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
====================

1) C++
2) Octave
3) Python


DEPENDENCIES
============

1) Boost
2) OpenCV
3) OpenMP (libgomp)
4) OpenMPI
5) liboctave
6) Yossi Rubner's implementation of Earth Mover's distance: http://vision.stanford.edu/~rubner
   Two files emd.c emd.h included here are from Rubner's code.
